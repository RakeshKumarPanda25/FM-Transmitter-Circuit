# FM-Transmitter-Circuit
The objective of this project is to make a prototype that can transmit the radio signal about 1km range using MATLAB, Multisim, and Hardware components. This device is used to transmit the radio signal using an RF-amplifier circuit in which we can broadcast the audio signal up to 1km range.
